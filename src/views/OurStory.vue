          Molly and Jason met in 2015 at the Hope Lodge. Molly was doing a college internship for class credit. She was pretty set on working in oncology and wanted some applicable experience. They became fast friends talking about everything under the sun but especially Taylor Swift and The Kentucky Wildcats. After the internship was over, they kept their friendship going and started tailgating together. Eventually they figured out they liked each other a whole lot more than friends.

          A vacation to New York City turned out to be the trip of a lifetime when Jason got down on one knee and asked Molly to marry him! Finally! They had tons of fun exploring the city and seeing The Book of Mormon on Broadway. Jason surprised Molly with reservations at her favorite restaurant in the world, Tamarind on the night they got engaged. They ordered a mango martini and bourbon to toast to a bright future together.
